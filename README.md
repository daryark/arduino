Simulations for all projects:

  1. LED Control:

       [1.0](https://wokwi.com/projects/409550879389034497) - 🟢 is ON until button unpressed. 🔴 & 🟡 SWITCH together every 1s.

       [1.1](https://wokwi.com/projects/409550740050040833) - 🟢 is ON until button unpressed. 🔴 & 🟡 SWITCH alternatively every 2s.

       [1.2](https://wokwi.com/projects/409550617394949121) - 🟢 is ON until button unpressed. 🔴 & 🟡 BLINK for 0.1s every 0.5s and 2s respectively.
  
  2. LED Control + LCD screen

       2.0 - LCD display shows the potentiometer value and corresponds it to the brightness of LED in real-time according to rotation of potentiometer.

       2.1 - Control the brightness of the LED from computer via Arduinto Serial Monitor(terminal).
  
  3. Servo Control
       3.0 - Servo motor and up to three sensors. Enable servo motor to move and orient itself in the direction of a light source detected by light detection algorithm and motor movement.

       3.1 - Intergrated second servo motor for another angle. The movement of 2 servo motors syncronized that allows smooth and coordinated tracking of the light source.
